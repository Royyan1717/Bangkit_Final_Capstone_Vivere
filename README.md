## Dental Caries Detection

The final capstone that we created are based on the government development plan, mainly on healthcare. 

Our team developed a machine learning model to classify whether a teeth is healthy or unhealthy (showing signs of teeth caries) and then deployed the model in the google cloud platform, then run the model on a final product on an Android platform.
